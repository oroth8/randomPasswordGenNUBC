# randomPasswordGenNUBC
A random password generator application that was made for Northwestern University Bootcamp

This application is a random password generator that creates a random password based on the options in the browser app. 
  A jumnotrop with a "generate password button" appears on the page. Once the user clicks the button a prompt occurs asking for the users desired password length. If the password is within the proper length (9-128) then the confirmation alerts appear on screen asking for the users options (upper case, lower case, numbers, or special characters). After the user selects all the options a randomly generated password is created and displayed on screen.
